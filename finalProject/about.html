				<h2>Message From the President</h2>
				<p>
					2020 marks the year that most would rather forget. While the complexities of quarantines and
					difficulties of life caused substantial hardship throughout our community, the strength of our
					small-town spirit was emboldened. With the help of programs from the federal, state, and local
					government, the Duvall Chamber of Commerce provided our local, small businesses with the tools and
					capital needed for many to survive. My name is Josh Lowell, and the owner of the law offices of
					Magnuson Lowell, P.S., and it will be my pleasure to continue leading the Duvall Chamber of Commerce
					into a bright new tomorrow.
				</p>
				<p>
					When times are tough, resiliency is built. From our gourmet restaurants and boutique shops to our
					skilled service providers and medical professional, the Duvall Chamber of Commerce will build upon
					the successful programs previously introduced. The local business community has expressed interest
					in new exciting and inventive platforms to showcase the wide array of offerings unique to small-town
					life. With the help of our dedicated Directors, staff, and loyal Members, we will expand and reach
					these new horizons in 2021.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Chamber, its incredible Board, and experienced staff will help provide the information and
					resources necessary for Members to prosper. With the vast community support at our back, the
					Snoqualmie Valley will grow, providing our 200 Members with the supplies, energy, and support to
					boost its customers and bottom line in the new year. We pledge as the Duvall Chamber of Commerce to
					Grow, Connect, and Prosper.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Duvall Chamber of Commerce welcomes businesses of all shapes and sized non-profit organizations
					and entrepreneurs looking to learn, network, and expand. Join us in 2021 for another amazing year!
				</p>
				<p>
					Joshua B. Lowell<br />
					President, Duvall Chamber of Commerce <br />
					Law Offices of Magnuson Lowell, P.S.
